  <em>Figure 4. For each  accession split, differential expression was also calculated for each of the 34,692 non-paired genes. This allowed for the identification of genes whose expression was impacted by SV presence/absence, but were not identified by position. E.g. genes: Solyc01g005100, Solyc01g005430.3, Solyc01g005430.3.
